materials with dimensions less than 1000 nanometer

classification
--------------
classify by amount of dimensions
-> 0 dimension
	-> in xyz direction
	-> eg. buckyballs, quantum dots
-> 1 dimension
	-> nanoscale in 2 direction
	-> eg. nanowires, nanotubes (can search carbon nanotube), nanorods 
-> 2 dimension
	-> 1 direction
	-> eg. nano coatings, thin film, hydrophobic coating on car windscreen
-> 3 dimension
	-> materials with nanocrystalline structure display nanoscale features
	-> can be bigger than nanoscale

nanomaterials
-------------
- can be naturally occurring or synthetic
	-> natural occurring
		-> eg. fine sand, dust, volcanic ash
	-> man made
		-> plastic

nanostructure
-------------
- a structure that can be made synthetically

making nanomaterials
---------------------
- bottom up approach
	-> like lego set
	-> layer atoms and molecules chemically
- top down approach
	-> cutting away material
	-> from big cut to smaller fragments

which method is better
----------------------
- top down approach is slow and expensive
- bottom up approach cheaper and faster, but process is synthesizing using chemicals
