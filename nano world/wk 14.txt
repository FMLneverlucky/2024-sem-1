growth in nanotech in life science and medicine industry
-> almost 80 bil by 2019
-> improvement in drug delivery system (surgery/ treatment method can be too painful e.g. cancer, radiography, chemotherapy)
-> making use of nanoparticles to detect/ target bad cells in body (to minimize damage of good cells)
-> drug delivery under biopharmaceutics
-> use of nanotech for diagnostic tools
-> make use of nanotech to implant materials (tissue cells)/ devices (pacemaker, hearing aids)
-> wound care products to kill germs n bacterials using nanotech

currently have a lot of nano material for medical/ pharmaceutical needs

cancer detection sensor
-> look for the presence of cancer cells

microchip based drug delivery system

nanocantilever
-> receptors on surface of cantilever
-> something about vibrations
-> surface like diving
-> way to detect unwanted particles
-> can be used for diagnosis in biomedical

wound care products
-> for antimicrobial functions
-> stop bleeding fast
-> reduced risk of renewed bleeding

nanotech will influence future of life science and medical products
has enabled breakthrough by going beyond limitations of current technology
