NEWater is nano tech process 
-> uses nano structured filters
desalination of sea water into clear water
there are sensors to detect contamination of water - called nano sensors
water scarce countries use desalination to obtain fresh water - middle east/ deserts, where it only rain once or twice a year

filters
-> make use of membranes to filter the water
-> e.g. carbon nanotube

nano sensors
-> detect harmful particles in water
-> cantilever 
- some part are fixed while others are flexible so (vibrations) can detect presence of unwanted agents
- (vibrations) --> makes use of resonance frequency**
- swim diving board surface

nano filtration
- e.g. lifestraw - a product to drink river water
