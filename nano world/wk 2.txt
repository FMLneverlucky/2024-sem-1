not touching into details of sciences

has a lot of consumer lifestyle products

medical -> can be pharmaceutical 

how technology improved the quality of life (better specification, cheaper production cost)

hazards that nano tech pose 
-> e.g. carbon nano tube, scientist use a layer on tire to make it sustain longer, safety and health hazard, is invisible to eye and toxic to inhale, will affect organs

=============================================================

notes:


solar panel
-> use nano materials for better efficiency

hydrophobic windscreen
-> coating only stays for 1 or 2 use, need reapply n is expensive

oled (organic light emitting diode)

mems (actually not nano but micro)
-> materials in micro scale

afm (atomic force microsopy) and stm (scanning probe microscopy)
-> tools for imaging, used to see surface of nano materials
