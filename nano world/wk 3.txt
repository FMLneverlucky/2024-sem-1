synthesis of material 

what is nano technology:
production technology to get the extra high accuracy and ultra fine dimensions (preciseness and fineness in nanometer)

definition of nano tech more specific to material (more accurate):
creation of functional materials, devices or systems through the control of said material on nanometer scale
-> function of that material or system becomes better

third definition (though not as focused on):
understanding and control of matter at a scale of 1 to 100 nanometers

examples:
hair dyes - ancient egyptians used lead oxide and something else i forgot to colour their hair
-> making use of chemicals to dye hair


new tools for atomic scale characterization -> new capabilities to atom manipulation
computational access to large systems of atoms and long time scales (whatever this means)
