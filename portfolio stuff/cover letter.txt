I am a Nanyang Polytechnic graduate who is interested in applying as a game tester intern at Early Learning Fun Preschool. As a fresh graduate, I would like to gain some experience creating games fit for the current gaming market. I also like to challenge myself to create games targeted for children, other than games for teens and young adults.
 
As a student studying in Game Development and Technology, I have learned how to programme in C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, Python and PHP. I also have experience in collaboration work using both unity and unreal engines. 
 
As a programmer experienced with collaboration projects, I have learnt that clear communication is vital to achieve results everyone is satisfied with. I am capable of completing my assigned tasks as well as peer reviewing and providing feedback. I have no problems working with unfamiliar people to produce a working product and lead my group when needed. As a result, I have successfully produced 4 games of different genres with my group mates. 
 
I believe that by allowing me to gain experience in your company, I can gain knowledge on the differing needs and wants of various age groups.  I also hope to be able to inspire children and help them find their passion. I sincerely hope to meet at an interview to get to know more about each other.
