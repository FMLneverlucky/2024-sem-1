branching narratives
--------------------
- user experiences a **unique story based on their interactions and choices**
- games have *large emphasis on story*
- adventure games provide the most direct way of *narrative implementaion* into a play

recommendations:
heavy rain
-> story qn: will mc be able to save his son
the walking dead
-> inciting incident: mc meets clementine
-> story qn: can mc bring clementine to find her family
maki island

examples from fighting fantasy gamebook:
house of hell

important points to consider:
- **what kind of choice are you making the player make**
- the more interesting the choices, the more engaging the story
- moral points, the pros and cons of each choice
- choices need to be probable**

example:
sugarcane island
batman
-> need to consider what thoughts the player think of
-> consider if game will be probable to happen or interesting to explore during replay 

- avoid random choices


conditional events
------------------
can improve replayability
