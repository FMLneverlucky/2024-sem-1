picture analysis of gravidia from portfolio page
------------------------------------------------
- player has health n mana bar
- player ui has 2 main cards that seem to shows special moves player can use in their current mode
	-> default: unknown
	-> ranged:
		1. circular thing with dot in middle, probably 		black hole, is probably the skill wif reverse firework effect that pulls in enemies
		2. looks like explosion skill, (I only just realised at this point, that selected card is darkened card) seen in picture named "repel"
	-> gravitium:
		1. standing at normal orientation, seen 		controlling platform with this skill 			highlighted, the "swing smack smack" attack
		2. standing upside down, picture is named 		"levitation" with this skill highlighted,
		shown as aoe explosion skill in trailer
- player has different weapons for each "mode"
	-> default: mace
	-> ranged: crossbow
	-> gravitium: magically looking wooden sledgehammer?
		=> seems like player can move platforms in 		this state
- player seems to be able to gain armour, shown in ui as a white bar covering over hp bar
- boss looks like a spider robot, kind of like urgot in a way but orange
	-> seems to be able to summon smaller minions? cant tell if they are regular enemies player encounter along the way (looks like regular enemies from cross reference)
- crystal and fire shown at bottom right of boss pic, not sure they floating or hovering on the ground
	-> cant tell what it does either
- regular enemies seen in trailer uses spears
- there is another type of enemy that has darker shade of armour and greenish core(?)
- player seems to be able to resurrect using 2 crystals within death timer in picture named "death"
- enemy speaks have hooks on them, kind of like those spears meant to trip/ decapitate horse legs so their rider fall off
